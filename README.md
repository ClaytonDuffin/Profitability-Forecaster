Script for forecasting the profitability of a business or organization who relies upon Twilio’s APIs for SMS, Voice, and \<Pay> services.
  
Takes into consideration expenses and revenues, and then shows (currently in four dimensions – the fourth being color) the results on operating cash flows given each scenario. It is unlikely to be a one-size-fits-all type of program, but it can certainly be adjusted with relative ease for your own set of circumstances. 
  
Upon runtime, the script will first compute and print (for the period) the net profit, the fixed-to-variable expense ratio, and the efficiency ratio. The script will then output a chart, as shown here.
